### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Roger, a newbie Full-Stack web developer. I discovered my passion for coding during my time at @lewagon bootcamp.
My final project, called [Musique, Where's The Funk](https://github.com/OmaryMahboob/le-musique-project), was a culmination of all the skills and knowledge I gained during the program. [musique.wtf](https://www.musique.wtf) is a social network for musicians and bands, providing a platform for both parties to connect and collaborate.

Since then, I've been working on various web development projects and sharing my knowledge as a proud TA for Speak & Code.

I'm constantly learning and striving to improve my skills in front-end and back-end development, and excited to collaborate with others in the tech community.
